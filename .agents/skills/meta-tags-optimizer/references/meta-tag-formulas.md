## A/B Testing Methodology for Titles and Descriptions

### Pre-Test Preparation

1. **Baseline metrics** — Record current CTR, average position, impressions, and clicks for the target page (minimum 30 days of data from ~~search console).
2. **Hypothesis** — State what you expect to change and why: "Adding a number to the title will increase CTR by X% because listicle titles outperform generic ones at this SERP position."
3. **Single variable** — Change only ONE element per test (title OR description, not both).
4. **Minimum sample** — Wait until the page has accumulated at least 1,000 impressions in the test period before drawing conclusions.

### Test Execution Steps

| Step | Action | Duration |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Record baseline CTR for 30 days | 30 days |
| 2 | Implement title/description change | Day 0 |
| 3 | Allow Google to re-crawl and update SERP | 3-7 days |
| 4 | Monitor new CTR (exclude first 7 days) | 30+ days |
| 5 | Compare new CTR vs. baseline at same avg. position | — |
| 6 | Decide: keep, revert, or iterate | — |

### What to Test (Priority Order)

| Priority | Element | Test Variable | Expected Impact |
|----------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Title tag | Add/remove number | +15-25% CTR |
| 2 | Title tag | Add/remove year | +10-15% CTR |
| 3 | Title tag | Add brackets/parentheses | +10-38% CTR |
| 4 | Title tag | Change power word | +5-12% CTR |
| 5 | Title tag | Reorder keyword placement | +5-10% CTR |
| 6 | Meta description | Add CTA | +5-10% CTR |
| 7 | Meta description | Add numbers/statistics | +5-15% CTR |
| 8 | Meta description | Change emotional tone | +3-8% CTR |

### Interpreting Results

| Scenario | Interpretation | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| CTR up, position stable | Title/description change is working | Keep the change |
| CTR up, position up | Improved engagement signals helping rankings | Keep and document |
| CTR down, position stable | Change was negative | Revert immediately |
| CTR flat, position stable | Change had no impact | Try a bolder variation |
| CTR up, position down | Higher CTR but lower impressions | Evaluate net click change |

### Statistical Significance Checklist

- [ ] Minimum 1,000 impressions in test period
- [ ] Test ran for at least 30 days (after re-crawl)
- [ ] Average position did not shift more than 2 positions
- [ ] No major algorithm updates during test period

## Multi-Language Title Optimization

### General Principles

1. **Do not translate literally** -- Adapt the title formula to the target language's natural phrasing and cultural norms.
2. **Character limits vary** -- CJK characters are wider; effective SERP display length is shorter by character count.
3. **Keyword research per locale** -- Search volume and intent differ across languages. Always do locale-specific keyword research.
4. **Brand name placement** -- Some markets prefer brand-first; others prefer keyword-first.

### Language-Specific Considerations

| Language | Max Chars (SERP) | Key Differences | Example Adaptation |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| English | 55-60 | Standard baseline | How to Learn SEO (2026 Guide) |
| Spanish | 55-60 | Longer phrases; use abbreviations | Como Aprender SEO: Guia Completa 2026 |
| French | 55-60 | Accented characters count same | Guide SEO Complet : Comment se Classer en 2026 |
| German | 50-55 | Compound words are long | SEO-Leitfaden 2026: Schritt-fur-Schritt |
| Japanese | 30-35 | CJK characters take ~2x width | SEO対策ガイド2026【初心者向け】 |
| Chinese (Simplified) | 28-32 | CJK characters; brackets common | SEO优化指南（2026完整版） |
| Korean | 30-35 | CJK width; particles add length | SEO 최적화 가이드 2026 [초보자용] |
| Arabic | 50-55 | RTL display; test SERP rendering | دليل تحسين محركات البحث 2026 |
| Portuguese (BR) | 55-60 | Similar to Spanish | Guia de SEO 2026: Como Ranquear no Google |
| Hindi | 45-50 | Devanagari takes more width | SEO कैसे करें: 2026 गाइड |

### Multi-Language Meta Description Tips

| Principle | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Localize the CTA | "Learn more" may not translate well; use culturally appropriate CTAs |
| Adjust character targets | For CJK, aim for 70-80 characters; for Latin-script languages, 150-160 |
| Use local proof points | Reference local statistics, regulations, or market leaders |
| Test SERP rendering | Use Google's SERP preview in the target locale to check truncation |
| Separate hreflang tags | Ensure each language version has the correct hreflang annotation |

## Common Title Tag Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Keyword stuffing | Google may rewrite your title | Use primary keyword once; vary phrasing |
| Too generic ("Home", "Welcome") | Zero CTR differentiation | Write a benefit-driven title |
| All caps | Looks spammy; may be rewritten | Use title case or sentence case |
| Missing primary keyword | Misses ranking signal | Include target keyword naturally |
| Duplicate titles across pages | Cannibalization; Google may pick wrong page | Unique title per page |
| Brand name first (non-branded query) | Wastes prime keyword space | Put brand at end after pipe |
| No emotional hook | Blends in with competitors | Add one power word or number |
| Exceeding 60 characters | Key info truncated in SERP | Front-load; keep under 60 chars |
| Misleading clickbait | High bounce rate hurts rankings | Title must match content delivery |
| Ignoring SERP context | Title doesn't stand out among competitors | Check live SERP before finalizing |
